<h1>ROW Vocabulary</h1>


<h1>10 Commandments</h1>
<p>"Religious and moral laws given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai and inscribed on two stone tablets. Also known as the Decalogue or the Ten Words, these laws begin with human beings&#x2019; duties to God and conclude with their obligations to one another. The Bible contains two versions of the Ten Commandments, in Exodus 20:1&#x2013;17 and Deuteronomy 5:6&#x2013;21, which are also scattered throughout the Quran. The Bible does not number these commandments, however, so Jews, Catholics, and Protestants have different iterations of them. There is no single Jewish version, but one widely used version begins with &#x201c;I the Lord am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage.&#x201d; Then follows, &#x201c;You shall have no other gods besides me.&#x201d; The Protestant version and the Catholic version (also accepted by most Lutherans) collapse these two injunctions into one. The Protestant Decalogue includes a prohibition against &#x201c;graven images&#x201d; not found in the Jewish or Catholic lists. The most important difference is between the Jewish commandment not to &#x201c;murder&#x201d; and the Catholic and Protestant commandment not to &#x201c;kill.&#x201d; Capital punishment and war would seem to be permissible in the former case, since arguably neither is murder, but not in the latter, since both involve killing. These three versions also differ at the end&#x2014;to enable each to add up to ten. While Catholics conclude with separate injunctions against coveting your neighbor&#x2019;s wife and coveting your neighbor&#x2019;s goods, Jews and Protestants compress covetousness into a single commandment.</p>
<p>The Decalogue has a long history in American public life. Cecil B. DeMille directed a popular silent version of The Ten Commandments in 1923, and his 1956 remake of the same name was a blockbuster. Inspired by the remake, which starred Charlton Heston as Moses, a Catholic group called the Fraternal Order of Eagles began constructing Ten Commandments monuments on public lands across the country. These displays occasioned a flurry of litigation in the 1990s and beyond. In 2005 the Supreme Court, whose courtroom is itself adorned with a carving of Moses and other lawgivers, banned two such monuments (both Protestant versions in Kentucky courthouses) and approved another (a Judeo-Christian version in the Texas capitol). The most famous recent spat on this subject featured the &#x201c;Ten Commandments Judge,&#x201d; Roy Moore, who, after refusing a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument he had installed at Alabama&#x2019;s state judiciary building, was removed from his post as Alabama&#x2019;s chief justice in 2003. Most Ten Commandments controversies have concerned displays on public property. A nonprofit group called Project Moses erects similar displays on private land. This organization is also lobbying for a Ten Commandments monument on the National Mall in Washington DC.255</p>
<p>Jewish Version</p>
<p>I the Lord am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage.</p>
<p>You shall have no other gods besides Me.</p>

<p>I am the Lord your God: You shall not have strange Gods before me.</p>

<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>4 Gospels</h1>
<p>"The four narratives of the life of Jesus included in the New Testament of the Christian churches. They are: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. In Greek, the language in which these books were written, the term gospel refers to &#x201c;good news.&#x201d; So these Gospels are the &#x201c;good news&#x201d; of the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Although these books all narrate Jesus&#x2019; life, they have different emphases. Matthew shows how Jesus fulfills Old Testament prophecies. Mark structures his story around the &#x201c;messianic secret&#x201d; that Jesus is the long-awaited messiah of the Jews. Luke accents Jesus&#x2019; concern for women and the poor. John contains a variety of &#x201c;I am&#x201d; sayings, which underscore Jesus&#x2019; divinity. Mark (circa 70 CE) is likely the earliest of the Gospels, which were written in the late first century. Matthew and Luke are probably based in part on Mark. Because of their similarities in structure and content these three books are called the synoptic Gospels. Of the Gospels, Americans&#x2019; favorite is Matthew, followed by John, then Luke, then Mark. In recent decades noncanonical gospels such as the Gospel of Thomas have piqued considerable interest. The best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code (2003) spurred interest in the Gospel of Mary, and the publication in 2006 of the long-lost Gospel of Judas, which depicts Judas not as Jesus&#x2019; betrayer but as his closest confidante, caused a stir."</p>

<h1>4 Noble Truths</h1>
<p>"Buddhism&#x2019;s core teachings, delivered by the Buddha in his first sermon at Sarnath, outside Varanasi in what is now northern India. The first truth (the Existence of Suffering) states that human life is characterized by dukkha, which is usually translated as suffering but also means unsatisfactoriness. The second truth (the Origin of Suffering) says that suffering is caused by clinging, which is caused in turn by ignorance, particularly ignorance of the impermanence of things. The third truth (the Cessation of Suffering) says that the chain of cause and effect that produces suffering can be reversed, resulting in liberation from suffering or nirvana. The fourth truth (the Path to the Cessation of Suffering) outlines the way to nirvana via the Eightfold Path of Buddhist practice." </p>

<p>"Symbols that identify male members of a Sikh order called the Khalsa, so called because each begins in Punjabi with the letter k. They are: kes, uncut hair; kangha, comb; kirpan, ceremonial sword; kara, steel wrist bangle; kachh, short pants. The 5 Ks were instituted in 1699 by Guru Gobind Singh, Sikhism&#x2019;s tenth guru, as a way to distinguish Sikhs from surrounding Hindus and Muslims. The kirpan has prompted many controversies in the United States. Public schools have wrestled with whether, as a matter of religious freedom, Sikhs should be allowed to wear kirpans at schools while Sikhs have struggled with whether it is permissible, in order to comply with school weapons bans, to dull their kirpans&#x2019; blades or confine them permanently in their sheaths. After 9/11 one of the people arrested was a turbaned Sikh man innocently carrying a kirpan on a train in Providence, Rhode Island."</p>

<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>5 Pillars of Islam</h1>
<p>"The key practices of Islam, obligatory for all Muslims. They are: Shahadah, or witnessing that &#x201c;There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God&#x201d;; salat, or prayer in the direction of Mecca five times a day (dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening); sawm, or fasting (from sunrise to sunset) during the lunar month of Ramadan; zakat, or almsgiving to the poor (via an asset tax); hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, once in a lifetime for all who are physically and financially able. Some critics of Islam wrongly claim that jihad is one of the Five Pillars. It is not. Muslims&#x2019; emphasis on these Five Pillars underscores the fact that Islam is more focused on right practice (orthopraxy) than on right belief (orthodoxy)."</p>

<h1>7 Sacraments</h1>
<p>"A sacrament is a religious rite that involves the manipulation of some tangible object (water, oil, bread, wine) and conveys God&#x2019;s grace to participants. Catholics (and most Orthodox Christians) acknowledge seven sacraments: baptism, confirmation, reconciliation (also known as penance or confession), Holy Communion, marriage, ordination of priests, and anointing of the sick (once referred to as last rites). Protestants classically acknowledge only two&#x2014;baptism and Holy Communion&#x2014;while some Protestant sects, notably the Quakers, reject sacramentalism altogether. Early twenty-first century debates about gay marriage highlighted the question of the sacramentalism of matrimony. If marriage is purely contractual, perhaps it can change with the times. But if marriage is ordained by God&#x2014;&#x201c;the visible form of invisible grace,&#x201d; in Saint Augustine&#x2019;s terms&#x2014;the barriers to gay marriage are much higher."</p>

<h1>ahisma</h1>
<p>non-harm or nonviolence</p>

<p>"Term in Hinduism, Buddhism, and especially Jainism, often translated as nonviolence, referring to not harming or wishing to harm. Described by Jains as the highest moral duty, this ideal informs such diverse practices in India as vegetarianism and the veneration of cows. It also motivates Jain ascetics to wear face masks and sweep the ground before them in order to avoid injuring even tiny insects. Ahimsa profoundly influenced Mohandas Gandhi (1869&#x2013;1948) and his nonviolent campaign for Indian independence, though Gandhi creatively reinterpreted this ideal in more positive terms&#x2014;as universal compassion. Through Gandhi, ahimsa also informed the nonviolent struggles of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement. Today this ideal plays a major part in the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s nonviolent struggle for Tibetan cultural autonomy."</p>

</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>al-Qaeda</h1>
<p>"International terrorist organization founded in the late 1980s by the wealthy Saudi-born financier Osama bin Laden (b. 1957). Al-Qaeda is best known for hijacking three jets on September 11, 2001, and crashing them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a Pennsylvania field. Influenced by Wahhabism and other forms of Islamist thought, al-Qaeda (&#x201c;the base&#x201d; in Arabic) emerged in 1989 out of an organization bin Laden used to finance the struggle of the Mujahideen (&#x201c;holy warriors&#x201d;) against Soviet occupation of Afghanistan&#x2014;a struggle funded in part by the United States. After the Soviets withdrew that same year, al-Qaeda enjoyed safe haven in Afghanistan under the Taliban, a theocratic Sunni state that punished theft by amputation, banned television, and mandated that women wear the full burqa (veil covering the entire body) in public. From that base al-Qaeda launched a &#x201c;holy war&#x201d; against Western occupation of Muslim lands, especially the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia. That jihad, as members called it, proceeds on two fronts: against the &#x201c;near enemy,&#x201d; Muslim-majority states&#x2014;Saudi Arabia chief among them&#x2014;that it regards as apostate; and against the &#x201c;far enemy&#x201d; of the United States and other Western powers that support those apostate regimes.</p>
<p>What al-Qaeda opposes is plainer than what it desires, but the organization seems to seek a transnational Islamic empire that adheres to a strict interpretation of Islamic law. In the nearer term al-Qaeda seems intent on instigating a &#x201c;clash of civilizations&#x201d; between Muslims and &#x201c;the Zionist-crusaders alliance&#x201d;&#x2014;a clash that goes back to medieval crusades and the life of Muhammad himself. Their hope is that such a struggle will, as another al-Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri (b. 1951), put it, &#x201c;purge our land from the aggressors.&#x201d;257</p>
<p>Responding to suicide bombings against US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the US military bombed al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan that was reportedly making nerve gas for bin Laden. After 9/11 the United States invaded Afghanistan and ousted the Taliban, sending bin Laden and his organization scattering. Although bin Laden eluded capture, roughly one thousand al-Qaeda members were arrested in dozens of countries, but al-Qaeda continued to operate."</p>

<h1>Allah</h1>
<p>"Term for God in Arabic and Islam. In the Quran Allah is described as merciful, gracious, and compassionate and is said to be the creator, sustainer, ruler, judge, and redeemer of the universe. Muslims traditionally ascribe to God ninety-nine &#x201c;beautiful names,&#x201d; including &#x201c;The Just,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Mighty,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Perfectly Wise.&#x201d; The most important teaching about Allah, however, is tawhid, or divine oneness, a view inscribed in the Shahadah, or Muslim creed, as &#x201c;There is no God but God.&#x201d; Rival understandings of God, including polytheism and the Christian view that God is somehow three in one, Muslims reject as shirk, or ascribing partners to Allah (who alone is divine).</p>
<p>One of the most common Muslim sayings is &#x201c;Allahu Akbar,&#x201d; or &#x201c;God is great.&#x201d; These words were the last sounds recorded on the cockpit voice recorder for United Flight 93, which terrorists crashed in rural Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, and there is a Muslim tradition of reciting this saying when going into battle to defend Islam. But Allahu Akbar is more commonly heard in both the traditional call to daily prayers and in the prayer ritual itself. Since 9/11 Americans have debated whether, as Muslims have traditionally claimed, the Islamic God is the same as the Jewish and Christian God. After 9/11 President George W. Bush affirmed that Muslims and Christians &#x201c;worship the same God,&#x201d; but many evangelicals disagreed. &#x201c;We should always remember,&#x201d; Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention said of Bush, &#x201c;that he is commander in chief, not theologian in chief.&#x201d;"</p>

<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>Apocalypse </h1>
<p>"Catastrophic end times battle in which the forces of good triumph over the forces of evil and usher in of a new age of justice and peace. In Greek, the term apocalypse refers to the unveiling of hidden things; what is being disclosed here is the messiah or the Christ and the horrors and glories that attend his coming. The most famous apocalyptic literature in the West is the New Testament book of Revelation, which is sometimes referred to as the Apocalypse. However, Christians borrowed the genre, which classically attends to such matters as the bodily resurrection and the last judgment, from Jews. This genre lives on in secular films such as Apocalypse Now (1979) and the pious Left Behind novels (1995&#x2013;) of Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. Many of America&#x2019;s new religious movements have anticipated an impending apocalypse. Seventh-Day Adventism emerged out of the prophecies of the Baptist farmer William Miller that the world would end on October 22, 1844. And the Branch Davidians of Waco, Texas, believed that their leader, David Koresh, was close to decoding the Seven Seals of Revelation when their compound went up in flames in 1993. Apocalypticism also plays a role in contemporary American politics, motivating many evangelicals and fundamentalists to support the state of Israel on the theory that the Jews must return to the Holy Land promised by God before Jesus will return to establish his kingdom. In a secular guise apocalypticism fueled the Y2K frenzy, which led many to fear that a minor computer bug would lead to a global economic meltdown on January 1, 2000."</p>

<h1>Apostles' Creed</h1>
<p>"Short statement of Christian beliefs, traditionally attributed to Jesus&#x2019; apostles but actually composed long after their deaths. The most popular creed in Christian worship services in the West, it reads (in one traditional English version):</p>
 

<p>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.</p>

<p>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>

<p>I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic Church; the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen."</p>

<h1>Armageddon</h1>
<p>"This Christian term, which appears only once in the Bible&#x2014;Revelation 16:16: &#x201c;the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon&#x201d;&#x2014;refers most narrowly to the place where the fiery battle between good and evil will take place in the last days. More broadly, it refers to this battle itself. Armageddon has captured the imaginations of many Christians and inspired a variety of best-selling novels, including Hal Lindsey&#x2019;s The Late Great Planet Earth (1970) and the Left Behind series (1995&#x2013;) of Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. This term, which is employed regularly in US House and Senate debates, has also been used to describe many historical conflicts, including the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. It is a transliteration of the Hebrew for &#x201c;Mount Megiddo&#x201d; in northern Israel."</p>

</head>

<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>atonement</h1>
<p>"For Christians, the death of Jesus on the cross, which somehow gets sinners right with God and wins them salvation. The &#x201c;somehow&#x201d; here is significant since Christians disagree on how the atonement operates, whom it affects, and what metaphors&#x2014;sacrifice? ransom? payment?&#x2014;best describe it. Substitutionary views, held by many conservative Christians, claim that on the cross Jesus either took upon himself the punishment brought on by human sins or paid a ransom to the devil to free humans from everlasting torment. Exemplary views, typically held by liberal Christians, see Jesus&#x2019; death as an example of divine love. Theologians have also differed over whether Jesus died for everyone (unlimited atonement) or just for the elect (limited atonement) and over whether the benefits of the atonement are available, as Protestants believe, to anyone who has faith or, as Catholics have traditionally affirmed, only to those who partake of the Catholic sacraments.</p>
<p>Atonement is also a feature of Judaism. On Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), which falls in the Jewish calendar just after Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year), Jews fast and pray, asking God to forgive them for sins committed in the prior year. Christian atonement theories were widely discussed after the release of the film The Passion of the Christ (2004) reinvigorated an ancient debate about whether Jews are responsible for Jesus&#x2019; crucifixion, but for the most part concerns about the atonement are muted in the contemporary United States, probably because hell is no longer a real and present danger for most Americans."</p>

<p>"Rite of initiation into the Christian community in which candidates are immersed in water or water is sprinkled or poured over them. Christians describe this practice, which they trace to Jesus&#x2019; baptism by John the Baptist, as dying and rising to new life, a cleansing of sins, and an infusion of the Holy Spirit. Baptism has provoked some of the most bitter disputes in Christian history. Is baptism a sacrament? Catholics and most Protestants say yes, but Quakers say no. Should it be administered to infants? Most Christians say yes, but Baptists insist on believers&#x2019; baptism. The Salvation Army does not baptize at all; and &#x201c;Jesus Only&#x201d; Pentecostals baptize in Jesus&#x2019; name alone rather than in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. A related practice is the baptism of the Holy Spirit (or spirit baptism), which Holiness, Pentecostal, and charismatic groups see as separate from water baptism and believe conveys such gifts of the Holy Spirit as speaking in tongues."</p>

<h1>Baptists</h1>
<p>"The largest Protestant group in the United States. Baptists distinguish themselves from other Christians chiefly by their rejection of infant baptism in favor of believers&#x2019; baptism. Baptism, they argue, is not a means of grace but a sign of grace already received. Throughout American history Baptists have been staunch advocates of the separation of church and state. Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s famous 1802 letter to Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut, commending a &#x201c;wall of separation between church and state&#x201d; was preaching to the choir; and one of the most powerful voices for strict church/state separation was Baptist Supreme Court justice Hugo Black, who grafted the &#x201c;wall&#x201d; metaphor onto the Constitution in Everson v. Board of Education (1947). Since the 1980s, however, Baptists&#x2014;Jerry Falwell and the &#x201c;Ten Commandments Judge&#x201d; Ray Moore among them&#x2014;have been some of the most vocal opponents of strict separationism. Like most US Protestant denominations, Baptists split regionally (into North and South) and racially (into black and white) in the nineteenth century. Their largest denomination today is the Southern Baptist Convention, which claims about twenty million members. The other major white Baptist group, American Baptist Churches in the USA, reports just under two million members and is more liberal both theologically and politically. Black Baptists cluster in four denominations: National Baptist Convention, USA; National Baptist Convention of America; Progressive National Baptist Convention; and National Missionary Baptist Convention of America.</p>
<p>Although Baptists came to prominence during the Second Great Awakening of the early nineteenth century, they did not place a member in the White House until Warren Harding in 1921. Three more Baptist presidents&#x2014;Harry Truman, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton&#x2014;followed. Carter was a Southern Baptist, but he cut ties with that denomination in 2000 after it lurched to the right in the Reagan era. Despite a widespread perception among secularists that Christian conservatives are overrunning American politics, Baptists are actually underrepresented in the Capitol. On surveys that ask Americans to name their religious preference, roughly 16 percent call themselves Baptists, but Baptists constituted only 14 percent of US Senators and House members in the 109th Congress."</p>

<h1>Bhagavad Gita</h1>
<p>"The most popular scripture in contemporary Hinduism, part of a Hindu epic called the Mahabharata, written in Sanskrit between 200 BCE and 200 CE. Central to the Gita is a battlefield discussion of Hindu ethics between an Indian warrior named Arjuna and the Hindu god Krishna (disguised as Arjuna&#x2019;s charioteer). A classic example of bhakti (or devotional) Hinduism, the book popularizes the teachings of the earlier and more philosophical Upanishads by describing three different paths to God: the disciplines of devotion (bhakti yoga), action (karma yoga), and knowledge (jnana yoga). First translated into English in 1785, the Gita became a favorite of the Transcendentalists, and Ralph Waldo Emerson once mistakenly referred to it as &#x201c;the much renowned book of Buddhism.&#x201d;258 Among American Hindus today it is the Hindu holy book par excellence, read and discussed in Gita study groups that mimic Christian Bible study groups. Robert Oppenheimer, who as a member of the Manhattan Project helped to design the first atomic bomb, reports that a quotation from the Gita came to mind when he witnessed the first nuclear explosion in New Mexico in 1945: &#x201c;I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.&#x201d;"</p>

<h1>Bible</h1>
<p>"The Jewish and Christian scriptures are both referred to as the Bible. The Hebrew Bible consists of twenty-four books divided into three sections: the Law, consisting of the Pentateuch, or the five books attributed to Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy); the Prophets (Jeremiah, Isaiah, and so on); and the Writings (various additional books, including Psalms, Proverbs, and Job). The Hebrew Bible is also called the Tanakh, which is an acrostic for the Hebrew words for each of these three parts (Torah for Law; Neviim for Prophets; and Ketuvim for Writings). The Christian Bible consists of the Old and New Testaments. Most Christian groups restrict the New Testament to twenty-seven books: four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John); the Acts of the Apostles; twenty-one letters, or Epistles, many attributed to Paul; and the apocalyptic book of Revelation. The Protestants&#x2019; Old Testament mirrors the content of the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible but divides them into thirty-nine books, for a total of sixty-six biblical books. Roman Catholic Bibles include seven additional Old Testament books, known to Protestants as the Apocrypha, for a total of seventy-three (or, if Prophecy of Jeremias and Lamentations of Jeremias are published as one book, seventy-two). Of the many English translations of the Bible, which was originally written in Hebrew and Greek, the most popular is the King James Version (1611). Today Americans can select from dozens of different translations, including New Testaments published as glossy magazines for youth and inclusive-language Bibles sensitive to feminist sensibilities.</p>
<p>The Bible has enjoyed a long and winding afterlife in American culture, inspiring thousands of novels, poems, films, plays, paintings, sculptures, songs, and other works of the imagination. It is the best-selling book in American history and an oft-invoked text in American public life. (&#x201c;Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other,&#x201d; President Lincoln said of the North and the South in 1865 in his Second Inaugural Address.) Many Americans regard the Bible as the Word of God, yet it is not universally beloved. Thomas Paine, whom Theodore Roosevelt once blasted as a &#x201c;filthy little atheist,&#x201d; called the Bible &#x201c;a book of lies and contradictions and a history of bad times and bad men.&#x201d; This is a minority view.</p>

<h1>Black Muslims</h1>
<p>AKA Nation of Islam</p>

<p>"Members of the black nationalist sect the Nation of Islam (NOI) founded in Detroit in the 1930s by W. D. Fard (?&#x2013;1934?) and led today by Louis Farrakhan (b. 1933). Under the leadership of Elijah Muhammad (1897&#x2013;1975), who spearheaded this group after Fard&#x2019;s disappearance in 1934, the NOI preached a heterodox combination of black nationalism and Islam that denounced whites as &#x201c;blue-eyed devils&#x201d; and hoped for a separate black nation. More traditional Muslims looked askance at the Black Muslims&#x2019; doctrines (the view that Fard was divine) and practices (fasting in December instead of Ramadan), but the movement grew throughout the sixties, particularly among black males in prisons, who gravitated to its strict discipline and its emphasis on self-help and self-respect. One prison convert was Malcolm X (1925&#x2013;1965), who before his assassination in 1965 was the most powerful alternative to the more moderate civil rights message of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. The most famous convert was the heavyweight boxing champion Cassius Clay, who proclaimed his conversion to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali in 1964.</p>
<p>After Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son and successor, Warith Deen Muhammad (b. 1933), took the Nation of Islam in the direction of orthodox Sunni Islam, admitting whites and renaming it the American Society of Muslims. In 1977 Farrakhan led a group that disagreed with Warith Deen Muhammad&#x2019;s mainstreaming strategy into a reconstituted Nation of Islam. Although his explosive rhetoric led many to denounce him as racist and anti-Semitic, Farrakhan retained sufficient clout among African Americans to organize the Million Man March on Washington DC in 1995. Not all African American Muslims are Black Muslims. In fact, the overwhelming majority of African American Muslims are members of far more traditional Sunni Muslim groups."</p>

This distinction has not caught on. For the most part the terms born-again Christian and evangelical are synonymous."</p>

<h1>Calvinism</h1>
<p>"Protestant theological tradition based on the teachings of the Swiss theologian John Calvin (1509&#x2013;1564), established in the North American colonies through the Puritans, and spread nationwide through Congregational and Presbyterian churches. Also known as Reformed theology, Calvinism draws its dynamism from two foundational tenets: the absolute sovereignty of God and the total depravity of human beings. One controversial doctrine that flows from these tenets is double predestination: the belief that God fated every human being, before birth, to either heaven or hell. Calvinism is most carefully encapsulated in the Westminster Confession of Faith (1647). It is most succinctly summarized in the Five Points of Calvinism of the Synod of Dort (1618&#x2013;1619), which can be remembered via the acronym TULIP: total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints. Calvinism dominated American theology until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when Arminianism&#x2014;the view, popular among evangelicals, that humans are free to accept or reject the saving grace of Jesus&#x2014;took hold. German sociologist Max Weber argued that Calvinism gave birth to capitalism by producing powerful theological motivations for both working hard and saving money."</p>

	<title>Catholicism, Roman</title>
</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>Catholicism, Roman</h1>
<p>"One of Christianity&#x2019;s three main branches, along with Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism, and the largest of the three. The term catholic means universal, and Catholics have always tried to be the church for the whole world. But as the adjective Roman implies, this church is centered in Rome and is led by a pope who doubles as that city&#x2019;s bishop. Roman Catholicism is administered by a hierarchy of bishops and priests, and since 1870 the pope has been empowered to speak infallibly on matters of faith and morals. While Protestants recognize only two sacraments, Catholics recognize seven: baptism, confirmation, reconciliation (also known as penance or confession), Holy Communion, marriage, ordination of priests, and anointing of the sick (once referred to as last rites). Catholics also differ from Protestants in their veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary and other saints, their insistence that the Bible be read in light of church traditions, and their restriction of the priesthood to males who take a vow of celibacy.</p>
<p>Roman Catholics preceded Protestants to the New World, planting their faith in both New Spain and New France, and were welcomed in the colony of Maryland, which was founded as a safe haven for Catholics in a sea of antipathetic Puritans and Anglicans. Catholics did not come in large numbers to the United States until the 1830s, but by 1860 they were the nation&#x2019;s largest single Christian denomination. Still, anti-Catholicism remained a major theme in American history well into the twentieth century; the country did not have a Catholic president until John Kennedy in 1960. American Catholics have a long history of speaking out on issues of war and peace, poverty and inequality. But the capacity of Catholic leaders to speak authoritatively on such matters was crippled in the early twenty-first century by a series of scandals involving sex between priests and young male parishioners.</p>
<p>Today American Catholics cluster in New England, the upper Midwest, and the Southwest, including southern California. Catholics are underrepresented in the US Congress but overrepresented in the Supreme Court. Five of its nine justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, are Catholics, making the current Supreme Court the first in US history with a Catholic majority."</p>

<p>Chinese Rites Controversy&#x2014;A dispute within the Church about whether or not Chinese folk religion rites and offerings to their ancestors constituted idolatry.

<h1>Christian Coalition</h1>
<p>"A successor of sorts to the Moral Majority, this conservative political pressure group, supported largely by white evangelicals and Catholics, was established in 1989 by Pat Robertson (b. 1930) after his failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Under the direction of Ralph Reed (b. 1961), who led it during its heyday in the mid-1990s, the Christian Coalition claimed more than 1.6 million members. It fell on hard times, however, in the early twenty-first century, in part because the Republican Party&#x2019;s ascent to power complicated its identity as a group of outside agitators. Today the Christian Coalition of America, as it is formally known, bills itself as a promoter of &#x201c;family values&#x201d; and &#x201c;America&#x2019;s leading grassroots organization defending our godly heritage.&#x201d; One testament to this group&#x2019;s success is a competing organization, called the Secular Coalition of America (established 2002), which represents the political interests of the American Humanist Association, Atheist Alliance International, and other skeptics.</p>

<p>"One of the mainline Protestant denominations, most visible in contemporary America in the United Church of Christ.

During the Great Awakening of the early eighteenth century Congregationalism split into prorevival (New Light) and antirevival (Old Light) factions. It later split along Trinitarian/Unitarian lines. In 1957 various Congregational groups merged into the United Church of Christ, whose 1.7 million members make it America&#x2019;s largest Congregationalist group. Congregationalists get their name from their insistence on the autonomy of the local congregation&#x2014;a form of church governance that characterizes some other denominations, including the Baptists, and many non-Christian groups."</p>

</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>creationism</h1>
<p>"The belief that the creation account in Genesis is historically and scientifically correct. The key claim here is not so much that God created the world in precisely seven days&#x2014;creationists differ on this point&#x2014;but that God created all species in a short time span and that human beings are not the result, as Charles Darwin argued, of the random process of natural selection. This creationist view, which has its roots in What Is Darwinism? (1874) by Princeton Theological Seminary theologian Charles Hodge, is often associated with the fundamentalist fringe. But surveys show that most Americans side in this debate with Hodge and only a small minority with Darwin.260 The battle between creation and evolution stood at the center of the Scopes &#x201c;Monkey Trial&#x201d; of 1925, which featured a Dayton, Tennessee, science teacher accused of violating a state law forbidding teachers from mentioning &#x201c;any theory that denies the Story of Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible.&#x201d; In 1987 the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law requiring public school districts that teach evolutionary theory to give equal treatment to &#x201c;creation science.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Since then Darwin&#x2019;s critics have increasingly spoken of &#x201c;intelligent design&#x201d; (ID) rather than creationism. According to intelligent design theory, both the universe and individual organisms in it are too complex to be the result of either chance or natural selection and must instead have been caused by an intelligent designer. Almost all scientists view this theory as pseudoscientific. In a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of an ID curriculum in public school biology classes in Dover, Pennsylvania, a US district judge agreed. Intelligent design may or may not be true, he ruled in 2005, but there is &#x201c;overwhelming evidence&#x201d; that it is &#x201c;a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory.&#x201d; Still, ID has its supporters, particularly on the Religious Right. President George W. Bush said in 2005 that public schools should teach both evolutionary theory and intelligent design."</p>

<h1>Crusades</h1>
<p>"Medieval military campaigns of the eleventh through the fifteenth centuries waged by Christians to recapture the Holy Lands from Muslims. The church offered indulgences for the remission of sins to crusaders, as Christian participants were called, and lauded those who died in these &#x201c;holy wars&#x201d; as martyrs. Although successful militarily, the crusades badly damaged Christian-Muslim relations, bringing on an era of mistrust and hostility that continues to characterize these relations today. In September 2001 President George W. Bush referred to the war on terrorism as a &#x201c;crusade,&#x201d; sparking anger among Muslims aware of the history of medieval crusades and the religious meaning of the term as &#x201c;taking the cross.&#x201d; Meanwhile, Osama bin Laden referred to the war on terrorism as &#x201c;a crusade against Islam,&#x201d; and his followers lauded him as &#x201c;the Second Saladin&#x201d;&#x2014;a reference to the Muslim hero who took Jerusalem by force in 1187.</p>

(&#x201c;My religion,&#x201d; wrote Thomas Paine, &#x201c;is to do good.&#x201d;) Deism, which emerged in seventeenth-century Europe and spread under the influence of the Enlightenment, was popular in the colonies at the time of the American Revolution and was the faith of many of the nation&#x2019;s founders. It was quickly overrun, however, by forms of faith that were more heartfelt and more recognizably Christian."</p>

</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>dispensational premillennialism</h1>
<p>"Dispensationalism is a school of Bible interpretation that divides sacred history into distinct periods, called dispensations, in which different plans for salvation apply. Premillennialism is the view that Jesus will return before the thousand-year reign (millennium) prophesied in the New Testament book of Revelation. When put together, these two terms create a core teaching of Protestant fundamentalism: dispensational premillennialism. According to this teaching, the end of the current dispensation is imminent. It will conclude with the Rapture of believers into heaven, followed for those who are left behind by a Great Tribulation of seven years, which will include the appearance of the Antichrist and the battle of Armageddon. But Jesus will come down from the clouds, defeat the Antichrist, and establish a thousand-year reign of peace and justice. This eschatology (or theology of the last days) was developed by the British theologian John Nelson Darby (1800&#x2013;1882), and it spread across the United States after the Civil War. Its greatest expression is the Scofield Reference Bible (1909) of Cyrus Ingerson Scofield (1843&#x2013;1921). More popular manifestations include Hal Lindsey&#x2019;s best seller, The Late Great Planet Earth, and the Left Behind novels (1995&#x2013;) of Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. Today dispensational premillennialism is the most popular form of prophecy belief in the United States, informing (among other things) conservative Christian support for the state of Israel."</p>

<p>"This term, Arabic for &#x201c;feast,&#x201d; refers to two festivals in the Muslim calendar: Eid al-Fitr, the feast of the breaking of the fast at the end of the month of Ramadan; and Eid al-Adha, the feast of sacrifice that concludes the pilgrimage to Mecca. On Eid al-Fitr, the lesser of these two festivals, Muslims pray, visit friends and family, and exchange gifts. On Eid al-Adha, they sacrifice a lamb or some other animal to commemorate both Abraham&#x2019;s willingness to offer his son Ishmael to Allah and Allah&#x2019;s mercy in accepting a lamb instead. In February 1996 President Bill Clinton welcomed Muslim families into the White House to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, prompting First Lady Hillary Clinton to call that holiday &#x201c;an American event.&#x201d;261 In September 2001 the US Postal Service issued a postage stamp (its first on a Muslim theme) celebrating both Eids. The calligraphy on the stamp read &#x201c;Eid mubarak&#x201d;&#x2014;a traditional holiday greeting meaning, &#x201c;May your festival be blessed.&#x201d;"</p>

	<title>Episcopalianism</title>
</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>Episcopalianism</h1>
<p>The Episcopal Church in the United States of America is part of the international Anglican Communion, which claims some 70 million members in a worldwide fellowship of self-governing churches that trace their roots to the Church of England. This church was founded in 1534 when King Henry VIII (1491&#x2013;1547) rejected papal authority and declared himself the head of the Church of England. Episcopalians take their name from the Anglican form of church governance, which is episcopal, meaning it includes bishops. Of all the major Protestant denominations, Episcopalianism is closest to the Roman Catholic tradition. Like Catholicism, it is liturgical, and its churches generally practice Holy Communion weekly. Also like Catholicism, Episcopalianism vests authority not only in scripture but also in tradition, though, unlike Catholics, Episcopalians add reason to this list of theological authorities.</p>
<p>The Church of England was established in colonial Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland, but it suffered mightily during and after the American Revolution since many of its clergy, particularly in the north, sided with the British. Still, many of the nation&#x2019;s founders, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, were Anglicans, as were two-thirds of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Today Episcopal churches are suffering through membership declines. In 2000 the Episcopal Church in the USA claimed only 2.5 million members (down from 3.4 million in 1960), and its unity was severely tested in 2003 when the Diocese of Vermont elected Gene Robinson as the first openly gay Episcopalian bishop. But Episcopalianism continues to have influence in corridors of power way out of proportion to its numbers. Roughly one-third of all Supreme Court justices and one-quarter of all US presidents have been Episcopalians, far more than any other denomination. And Episcopalians commanded forty-two seats in the 109th Congress&#x2014;about thirty-three more than their current share of the US population would warrant.</p>

	<title>evangelicalism</title>
</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>evangelicalism</h1>
<p>"The term evangelical (from a Greek word meaning &#x201c;good news&#x201d;) is often confused with the word evangelistic, which means intent on proselytizing. Although evangelicals are typically also evangelistic, the term evangelical has a more specific meaning. It refers to theologically conservative Protestants who stress the experience of conversion (being &#x201c;born again&#x201d;), view the Bible as the inspired and authoritative Word of God, emphasize evangelism, and believe that salvation comes by faith in the atoning death of Jesus Christ. Or, as British historian David Bebbington has put it, they affirm conversionism, Biblicism, activism, and crucicentrism.</p>
<p>Since the early nineteenth century, when evangelicalism became the dominant religious impulse in the United States, evangelicals have played a major role in American political and social life (often on the left), spear-heading such movements as abolitionism, temperance, and women&#x2019;s rights, and otherwise acting as an informal yet potent Protestant establishment. Evangelicals largely disappeared from public view after the embarrassment of the Scopes &#x201c;Monkey Trial&#x201d; of 1925, only to reemerge&#x2014;this time on the right&#x2014;in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Evangelicals should not be confused with fundamentalists. Whereas fundamentalists describe the Bible as the infallible Word of God, evangelicals insist merely that the Bible is divinely inspired. Fundamentalists also tend to be more antimodern than evangelicals, whose success in American culture can be attributed in considerable measure to their ingenuity in applying all manner of modern conveniences (books, magazines, radio, television, the Internet) to Christian ends.</p>
<p>Evangelicals are exceedingly unpopular among those on the Secular Left. A 2002 poll concerning non-Christians&#x2019; perceptions of such groups as military officers, lawyers, and lesbians found that evangelicals ranked tenth out of eleven groups, ahead only of prostitutes. There is reason to believe, however, that this antipathy is based in part on misunderstanding. Although many evangelicals today are conservative Republicans, significant minorities describe themselves either as &#x201c;liberal&#x201d; or &#x201c;moderate.&#x201d; Moreover, most evangelicals favor increasing taxes to help the poor and stricter government regulations to protect the environment. In 2004 the National Association of Evangelicals (established 1943) issued &#x201c;an evangelical call to civic responsibility&#x201d; that interpreted Genesis as a call to &#x201c;show our love for the Creator by caring for his creation.&#x201d; In 2005 an Evangelical Climate Initiative, supported by many leading American evangelicals, urged the US government to tackle the problem of global warming by substantially reducing carbon-dioxide emissions."</p>

<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>Exodus</h1>
<p>"Exodus (&#x201c;departure&#x201d; in Greek) refers both to the second book of the Hebrew Bible and to the epic story told in that book&#x2014;of the flight of the Israelites and their leader Moses out of slavery in Egypt and (after forty years in the wilderness and Moses&#x2019;s death) into the Promised Land. Key events in this grand narrative include Moses&#x2019;s receipt of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, the Ten Plagues of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, the appearance of manna from heaven, and God&#x2019;s guidance of his chosen people by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. This story has inspired a variety of American groups, who have read into it analogies with their own experiences. African Americans interpreted their passage from slavery to freedom to civil rights as an Exodus tale. Mormons also understood their trek from Illinois to the Great Salt Lake basin in Utah as an exodus, complete with Brigham Young (1801&#x2013;1877) as their &#x201c;American Moses.&#x201d; The Puritans too saw themselves as a chosen people in covenant with God in the Promised Land of New England. Exodus imagery also captured the imaginations of the nation&#x2019;s founders. Thomas Jefferson once suggested that the national seal should depict &#x201c;the children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night&#x201d;; Benjamin Franklin favored an image of Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea."</p>

	<title>family values</title>
</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>family values</h1>
<p>"Although this term sounds ancient, it is actually of recent vintage, first used in its current sense in the late 1960s and injected into American cultural politics in the late 1970s. The Republican Party platforms of 1976 and 1980 endorsed &#x201c;family values&#x201d; as an antidote to what conservatives saw as the moral degradation of American society brought on by the sexual revolution, rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll, and the counterculture. By the early 1980s this phrase&#x2014;and related ones such as traditional values and moral values&#x2014;had come to serve as code for opposition to &#x201c;atheistic schools, rampaging crime, God-forsaken homes, drugs, abortion, pornography, permissiveness and a sense of cynicism and spiritual desolation absolutely unprecedented in our country&#x2019;s history.&#x201d; At the 1992 Republican Party Convention, secretary of education William Bennett (b. 1943) called family values &#x201c;a great dividing line between the parties,&#x201d; and presidential candidate Pat Robertson accused President Clinton of hatching &#x201c;a radical plan to destroy the traditional family.&#x201d; Groups such as Focus on the Family (established in 1977) later extended the family values agenda to include support for parochial school vouchers and public school prayer.263</p>
<p>The term family values often serves as a proxy for &#x201c;religious&#x201d; in American political rhetoric. To be a family values candidate is to be a person of faith (and to appeal to conservative Christians). Many question, however, whether either Jesus or Paul exhibited family values. Both opposed divorce, but Paul preferred celibacy to marriage, and&#x2014;The DaVinci Code (2003) notwithstanding&#x2014;Jesus never married or had children. Moreover, Jesus repeatedly told his followers that he had come not to strengthen families but to set family members against one another: &#x201c;If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;he cannot be my disciple&#x201d; (Luke 14:26)."</p>

<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>fatwa</h1>
<p>"Islamic legal opinion given by a legal scholar (mufti) in the context of a particular school of law and in response to a specific question posed by a court or individual. Although many non-Muslims believe that fatwas are infallible declarations, most Muslims understand them to be binding only on those who recognize the authority of the legal scholar who issues them. This term burst into public prominence in the West after Iran&#x2019;s Ayatollah Khomeini (d. 1989) issued a fatwa calling for the assassination of Salman Rushdie, whose novel The Satanic Verses (1988) he deemed blasphemous. More recently, Americans have had to grapple with the 1998 &#x201c;fatwa&#x201d; of Osama bin Laden, which stated, &#x201c;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies&#x2014;civilians and military&#x2014;is an individual duty for every Muslim.&#x201d; Less well known is the July 2005 fatwa issued by the eighteen-member Fiqh Council of North America, which declared, &#x201c;All acts of terrorism targeting civilians are haram (forbidden) in Islam.&#x201d; Many Muslim leaders have observed that bin Laden, who is not a legal scholar, has no authority to issue a fatwa. Even Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar admitted that any so-called fatwas issued by bin Laden are &#x201c;illegal and null and void.&#x201d;264"</p>

<h1>First Amendment</h1>
<p>"The First Amendment to the US Constitution contains&#x2014;in addition to protections of freedom of speech, press, assembly, and petition&#x2014;two clauses concerning religion: the establishment clause, which states that &#x201c;Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion,&#x201d; and the free exercise clause, which adds, &#x201c;or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&#x201d; Rejecting the European model of one religion per state, the First Amendment transformed the American religious landscape into a thriving spiritual marketplace in which different religions, and different versions of each, competed for believers, donations, and public power.</p>
<p>Upon its ratification in 1791, the First Amendment applied only to the federal government&#x2014;Massachusetts maintained a Congregational establishment until 1833&#x2014;but after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, all state and local laws had to answer to the entire Bill of Rights. In recent years the Supreme Court has turned to the First Amendment to decide establishment clause cases concerning &#x201c;under God&#x201d; language in the Pledge of Allegiance, school prayer, and Ten Commandments displays on public property. Free exercise cases have taken up animal sacrifice by Santeria practitioners and the ritual use of the hallucinogen peyote by members of the Native American Church. In the last of these cases, Oregon v. Smith (1990), the Supreme Court ruled that laws can restrict religious freedom as long as they are universally applicable; in this case, drug laws can abridge the religious freedom of Native Americans as long as those laws apply to all citizens and all religions. Strong opposition to this controversial decision, which severely restricted the range of religious freedoms protected by the First Amendment, led to the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which became law in 1994 but was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1997."</p>

</head>

<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>fundamentalism</h1>
<p>"Many Americans today cannot tell an evangelical from a fundamentalist, but the differences are significant. Both groups stress conversion. Both typically oppose premarital sex, abortion, and homosexuality. Both also emphasize the Bible, though evangelicals usually speak of its divine inspiration, especially in matters of the spirit, while fundamentalists affirm its inerrancy on all subjects, including history and science. The most salient distinction between the two groups, however, concerns their attitudes toward modernity. Historian George Marsden once defined a fundamentalist as &#x201c;an evangelical who is angry about something.&#x201d;265 And what fundamentalists are angry about is modernity. Evangelicals, by contrast, are unabashedly modern, having taken to new technologies&#x2014;from the radio to television to the Internet&#x2014;with glee.</p>
<p>The roots of fundamentalism run to the late nineteenth century, when conservative Protestants first distilled their faith down to such basics as biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth of Jesus, miracles, the substitutionary atonement, and Jesus&#x2019; bodily resurrection. But fundamentalism proper first emerged with (and took its name from) the publication of The Fundamentals (1910&#x2013;1915), a twelve-volume series that sought to distinguish true Christianity from liberal Protestantism, which fundamentalists refused to recognize as legitimately Christian. Fundamentalists had their coming-out party at the &#x201c;Monkey Trial&#x201d; in 1925 in Dayton, Tennessee, where a public school science teacher was tried for illegally teaching evolutionary theory. William Jennings Bryan, who represented the creationists and the state of Tennessee, won the trial, but Clarence Darrow, his courtroom antagonist, won the public relations war, sending fundamentalists into self-imposed exile for decades. Although fundamentalists have long been stereotyped as anti-intellectual rubes, they have always stressed the importance of doctrine. The Fundamentals is a broadside against theological modernism, but it also criticizes evangelicals for neglecting truth in the name of experience.</p>
<p>Some scholars have tried to apply this term to other modes of religiously inspired antimodernism: to the Wahhabi school of Islam, which insists on reading the Quran literally and strictly applying its teachings to contemporary life; to right-wing Hindu nationalists in the Bharatiya Janata Party in India; or to Ultra-Orthodox Jews. But fundamentalism proper is a Protestant impulse that bears only superficial similarities to such movements.</p>

<h1>Genesis</h1>
<p>"The first book in the Bible and the most influential biblical book in American life, Genesis has given the world an extraordinary rich religious and cultural legacy: characters such as Adam, Eve, the Serpent, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Joseph, and the Pharaoh; places such as the Garden of Eden and Sodom and Gomorrah; events such as creation, the flood, and the binding of Isaac; and perennial themes such as the covenant between God and humans, the conflict between good and evil, and the battle of the sexes. Genesis&#x2019; account of creation in seven days occasioned a pitched battle over the new geology before the Civil War and over evolution after it. That battle continues today in lawsuits over the propriety of teaching intelligent design in the public schools. On the contentious question of global warming and the environment, Green Christians read Genesis as commanding human beings to act as stewards of the Earth while those who dismiss Christian environmentalists as tree-hugging pagans read that same text as commanding humans to exert dominion over it."</p>

<p>"The most common moral maxim in the world&#x2019;s religions, expressed by Jesus as, &#x201c;Do to others what you would have them do to you&#x201d; (Matthew 7:12, NIV). The Golden Rule is often confused with the related admonition to &#x201c;love your neighbor as yourself,&#x201d; which appears repeatedly in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. In his October 2000 presidential debate with Al Gore, George W. Bush (in response to a question on gun control) conflated these two commandments when he said Americans needed to follow the &#x201c;larger law&#x201d; to &#x201c;Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.&#x201d; President Kennedy got the Golden Rule right in June 1963 in a televised speech regarding a court order to desegregate the University of Alabama. &#x201c;The heart of the question,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.&#x201d; The Golden Rule has also been attributed to other religious leaders, including Confucius, Muhammad, and the first-century rabbi Hillel"</p>

<h1>hadith</h1>
<p>" Islamic sacred tradition, second in importance only to the Quran, relating the words and deeds of Muhammad and his companions as transmitted by trusted confidantes. Muslims interpret the Quran in light of these hadith and use their teachings, which they believe to be divinely inspired, to conform their lives to the exemplary life of Muhammad. A given hadith contains two parts: a text and a chain of authority. The latter, which traces the transmitters of the text back to its source, is used to determine how much trust to place in a given hadith (which Muslim scholars classify as &#x201c;sound,&#x201d; &#x201c;good,&#x201d; or &#x201c;weak&#x201d;). Those who have compared the Quran in Islam to Jesus in Christianity&#x2014;both are the revelations of God&#x2014;see the hadith as analogous to the Christian New Testament. In any case, it stands alongside the Quran itself as one of two key sources of Islamic law. There are six major Sunni compilations, the most authoritative of which are the &#x201c;authentic&#x201d; compilations of Bukhari and Muslim (each named after its compiler). Shiites have their own collections of hadith, which include in addition to the sayings and deeds of Muhammad those of their imams.</p>

<h1>Hanukkah</h1>
<p>"Jewish festival of lights, which lasts for eight days and roughly coincides with Christmas. This minor holiday commemorates a miracle first described in a compilation of rabbinic disputations called the Talmud. After foreign soldiers desecrated Jerusalem&#x2019;s Second Temple in the second century BCE, Judas Maccabee purified and rededicated it on the twenty-fifth day of the Jewish month of Kislev (when Hanukkah now starts). Although there was only a one-day supply of holy oil, that supply miraculously lasted for the eight days it took Maccabee to complete his work. Today Jews celebrate Hanukkah (lit. &#x201c;dedication&#x201d;) by saying prayers and lighting candles each evening for eight days. The lamp that holds the eight candles is called a menorah.</p>
<p>In the United States Hanukkah has become something of a Jewish Christmas, with gift giving and (in some cases) tree trimming. The holiday has been widely discussed in US politics in the context of public displays of nativity scenes, which often include menorahs and other Hanukkah symbols to signal their interreligious nature (and therefore their constitutionality). In &#x201c;The Hanukkah Song,&#x201d; comedian Adam Sandler pokes fun at fellow Jews who feel somewhat underserved by Hanukkah at Christmastime, offering them a long list of &#x201c;people who are Jewish, just like you and me.&#x201d; &#x201c;David Lee Roth lights the menorah,&#x201d; he croons. &#x201c;So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah.&#x201d;"</p>

Hare Krishnas brought (and lost) a number of landmark lawsuits that helped to define First Amendment jurisprudence. In Heffron v. ISKCON (1981) the Supreme Court ruled that Hare Krishnas were subject to licensing regulations regarding distributing literature and soliciting donations at the Minnesota state fair. In ISKCON v. Lee (1992) the Supreme Court held that local regulations banning Hare Krishnas from asking for donations at airports were constitutional.</p>

<h1>hijab</h1>
<p>"This Arabic term refers to any partition separating two things, but most commonly to a veil or head covering worn by some Muslim women. The Quran mandates modesty in female dress but does not say what form this modesty should take. So hijabs vary considerably from country to country and believer to believer, and many Muslim women wear no head coverings at all. Since the 1970s the veil has become a battleground between Muslims and Westerners. Many feminists see the veil as the symbol par excellence of the oppression of women in Islam. But many Muslim women, both in the United States and abroad, see head scarves as symbols of Muslim identity and of resistance to the sexual libertinism of Western societies. In the early twenty-first century American courts adjudicated many contests over whether the First Amendment&#x2019;s free exercise clause offers Muslim women the right to cover their hair when doing so would violate dress codes in public schools, jails, police units, or the armed forces."</p>

<h1>Holy Communion</h1>
<p>"A central act of Christian worship, also referred to as Eucharist, Lord&#x2019;s Supper, and Mass, this communal meal, typically celebrated with bread and wine (or grape juice), recalls the Last Supper of Jesus and his disciples on the night before his crucifixion&#x2014;a rite that is popularly said to be based on the Passover Seder meal of the Jews. Christians differ over how important Holy Communion is, how often to celebrate it, how old you should be to participate, and to what extent Jesus&#x2019; presence in the ritual is to be understood symbolically or literally. The Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation teaches that the bread and the wine are somehow transformed during this liturgy into the body and blood of Jesus. Some liturgically minded Protestant groups, notably Episcopalians and Lutherans, deny transubstantiation yet insist on the &#x201c;real presence&#x201d; of Jesus. Less liturgically minded Protestants, such as the Methodists and the Baptists, see the rite simply as a memorial."</p>

<p>"To Sunni Muslims, an imam (&#x201c;leader&#x201d; in Arabic) is simply the man who leads a congregation in prayer. To Shiite Muslims, an imam is far more important: a descendant of Muhammad chosen by God to lead the community in all areas of belief and practice. Shiites disagree on whether there were five, seven, or twelve imams, but most believe that a &#x201c;hidden imam&#x201d; is coming at the last days to restore peace and justice on earth. During the Iranian Revolution of 1979 the Ayatollah Khomeini was referred to as an imam, in keeping with the Shiite practice of referring to jurists by that title. In the United States, imam has evolved into a title of respect, akin to Reverend, as in Imam Siraj Wahhaj of Brooklyn, who in 1991 became the first Muslim to offer a prayer before the US House of Representatives.</p>

<h1>Jehovah's Witnesses</h1>
<p>"A Protestant denomination, officially known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, rooted in the end-of-the-world teachings of Charles Taze Russell (1852&#x2013;1916). This rapidly growing group claims about a million adherents in the United States but nearly seven million active members worldwide. Witnesses, as members are called, live up to their name. They are aggressive door-to-door evangelizers, and they publish their Watchtower magazine, which Russell began in the 1870s, in 152 languages. They became notorious in early twentieth-century America for refusing to salute the flag or serve in the military. Their unorthodox theological views extend to denying the Trinity and refusing blood transfusions. Witnesses have been quite active in the legal arena, taking dozens of cases to the Supreme Court&#x2014;more than any other religious group. In Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940), the Supreme Court ruled that Witnesses in public schools could be forced to salute the flag (which members understand as a form of idolatry). After that decision was interpreted by vigilantes as a warrant to attack Witnesses and burn down their Kingdom Halls, the Supreme Court quickly reversed itself in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), upholding Witnesses&#x2019; right not to salute the flag. The most influential case involving this group was Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940), which extended First Amendment protections from the federal to the local and state levels and vastly expanded the range of religious liberty for all minority religions in the United States.</p>

<h1>Jerusalem</h1>
<p>"Known by Muslims as al-Quds (&#x201c;The Holy&#x201d;) and mentioned more than 600 times in the Hebrew Bible, Jerusalem is a sacred place for Jews, Christians, and Muslims and a magnet for both pilgrimage and tourism. As much an idea as a reality, it is built on the metaphors of exile and return and on the blood of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim martyrs who fought to control it during the crusades of the Middle Ages. Its many holy places include: for Jews, the remains of the Western Wall of the Second Temple; and for Christians, the Via Dolorosa, along which Jesus walked to his crucifixion, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on the site where according to tradition he was buried and resurrected. Muslims consider Jerusalem sacred because it is where the angel Gabriel took Muhammad on his famed &#x201c;night journey&#x201d;&#x2014;from the mosque in Mecca to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and then to the heavens to converse with prior prophets and to learn how to pray.</p>
<p>Conquered by King David, Jerusalem was the site of Solomon&#x2019;s Temple until the Babylonians sacked the city and destroyed that landmark in 586 BCE. The Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. Since that time control over Jerusalem has passed back and forth between Christians, Muslims, and Jews. Today both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital, and this city&#x2019;s status remains a major sticking point in Middle East peace negotiations. Conflicting religious convictions remain a major reason why those negotiations are so difficult and the conflicts they seek to resolve so bitter."</p>

<h1>jihad</h1>
<p>"The term jihad is derived from an Arabic word that means &#x201c;to struggle&#x201d; or &#x201c;make an effort.&#x201d; So to participate in a jihad is to struggle on behalf of God. Muslims see two different types of jihads. The greater is the spiritual struggle of each believer against his or her lesser nature. The lesser is the physical struggle against enemies of Islam, a category that has traditionally included polytheists but not Jews or Christians (whom Muslims classically regard as fellow &#x201c;people of the book&#x201d;). In these physical struggles Muslims are enjoined to fight in accordance with strict regulations (including prohibitions against harming women, children, the old, the sick, and other noncombatants). Those who participate in such a jihad are called Mujahideen, a term popularized by opponents of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Individuals who die in this sort of battle may be revered as martyrs who go straight to paradise without having to wait (as others must) for the final judgment. Recently some radical Muslims have tried to modify the strict rules governing the &#x201c;jihad of the sword,&#x201d; particularly rules against injuring or killing women, children, civilians, and fellow Muslims. Others have tried to expand the Five Pillars to include a sixth: jihad. Still others have tried to break down the long-standing tradition between &#x201c;holy wars&#x201d; in defense of Islam, which have been widely accepted as legitimate, and offensive &#x201c;holy wars,&#x201d; which have been seen as more dubious. Few Muslims, however, have accepted these reinterpretations. The only groups that stress jihad as &#x201c;holy war&#x201d; are Muslim extremists and extreme critics of Islam."</p>

<h1>Judaism, Conservative</h1>
<p>"Middle path between Orthodox and Reform Judaism originally known as &#x201c;Historical Judaism.&#x201d; Conservative Judaism, which arose in nineteenth-century Europe in response to perceived excesses of Reform Judaism, is closer to Orthodox Judaism when it comes to observing the Sabbath and kosher dietary laws. Like Reform Jews, however, Conservative Jews accept the ordination of women, mixed-gender seating in synagogues, and biblical criticism. In the United States Conservative Judaism traces its roots to the opening in 1887 of the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), which was established in opposition to the Reform Jews&#x2019; Pittsburgh Platform of 1885 (and a notorious banquet at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati where guests were served shrimp, a food forbidden by Jewish dietary laws). Thanks to the leadership of JTS president Solomon Schechter (1847&#x2013;1915), Conservative Judaism took organizational shape with the founding in 1913 of the United Synagogue of America (now United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism), a group that currently accounts for roughly one-third of all religiously observant American Jews. Outside the United States Conservative Judaism is known as Masorti (&#x201c;Traditional&#x201d;) Judaism. Reconstructionist Judaism, which views Judaism as a civilization and not just a religion, is an offshoot of the Conservative movement."</p>

After World War II Americans began to use this slogan to distinguish their &#x201c;one nation under God&#x201d; from the Soviet Union under godless Communism. This &#x201c;triple melting pot&#x201d; ideal informed the decision of the Reverend Jerry Falwell to open the doors of the Moral Majority to Catholics and Jews as well as Protestants. After 9/11 some have tried to redefine the United States as a country of Christians, Jews, and Muslims&#x2014;a &#x201c;Judeo-Christian-Islamic&#x201d; nation.

<p>"Neologism, dating to the 1980s, that describes Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as sister faiths in a hybrid religious tradition undergirding the American way of life. This model of America can be seen in presidential rhetoric, which since the turn of the twenty-first century has tended to refer when discussing religious congregations to &#x201c;churches, synagogues, and mosques&#x201d; rather than simply &#x201c;churches and synagogues.&#x201d; It was championed by American Muslim groups during the 1990s and moved into broader circulation after 9/11. In 2003 groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American Muslim Council argued that Americans should stop referring to the United States as &#x201c;Judeo-Christian&#x201d; and use &#x201c;Judeo-Christian-Islamic&#x201d; or &#x201c;Abrahamic&#x201d; instead. Liberal Christian groups such as the National Council of Churches welcomed this change in nomenclature, but more conservative organizations such as the National Association of Evangelicals dismissed it as political correctness run amok."</p>

<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>just-war</h1>
<p>"Catholic tradition, dating to Thomas Aquinas, describing both what makes a war just (jus ad bellum) and what conduct is justifiable during such a war (jus in bello). Concerning how to conduct a war, just war theorists often cite such principles as &#x201c;discrimination&#x201d; (which says that combatants should direct their aggression against other combatants rather than innocent civilians) and &#x201c;proportionality&#x201d; (which says that force cannot be out of proportion to the injury suffered). Just war theory also prohibits torture and mandates proper care for prisoners of war. Many of its tenets were codified in the Geneva Conventions of 1949. In recent years just war theory surfaced, implicitly or explicitly, in debates concerning suicide bombings in Israel, the treatment of prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the alleged torture of terrorists overseas. This tradition of moral reasoning is opposed by pacifists, who believe that war can never be morally justifiable, and by &#x201c;realists,&#x201d; who say that war is inherently immoral and should not therefore be called to the bar of justice."</p>

The Kabbalah Centre of Los Angeles disseminated Kabbalistic beliefs and practices to a wide variety of celebrities, including Demi Moore, Britney Spears, and Madonna, who were seen sporting its trademark red string bracelets. Critics decried the Kabbalah Centre as a &#x201c;cult&#x201d; and the teachings of its leader, Rabbi Philip Berg (b. 1929), as &#x201c;McMysticism.&#x201d; But Berg defended his approach as a way to bring Kabbalah to people of other faiths (and none at all).</p>

The Kama Sutra, written by the Hindu thinker Vatsyayana around 400 CE, is an explicit treatise on sexual pleasure. Widely read and frequently translated, it discusses sixteen different types of kisses and a plethora of positions for sexual intercourse. The Sanskrit word kama should not be confused with the Sanskrit word karma, which means action."</p>

<h1>karma</h1>
<p>"In Sanskrit, karma refers both to an action and its consequences, but the term connotes more broadly the ethical law of cause and effect that drives samsara, the never-ending cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and other Asian religions. According to this law, which like gravity operates without divine intervention, positive consequences follow from good actions and negative consequences from bad actions&#x2014;either in this lifetime or in a future incarnation. One troubling corollary of this tradition is that all of us deserve the circumstances into which we are born. Thinkers disagree about whether &#x201c;good karma&#x201d; can be transferred from one person to another. Classically, the answer to that question is no. But as more devotional understandings of Asian religions developed, many came to believe that gods, Buddhas, and other supernatural beings can transfer to their devotees portions of the vast storehouses of merit they accrued over lifetimes of good deeds. Now an English word, karma refers in popular parlance to the tendency for &#x201c;what goes around&#x201d; to &#x201c;come around,&#x201d; as in the bumper sticker: &#x201c;My Karma Ran Over My Dogma.&#x201d;"</p>

<h1>martyr</h1>
<p>"In Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, a martyr (from the Greek word martys or &#x201c;witness&#x201d;) is someone who dies, typically young and violently, for a sacred cause. According to popular Islam, the Muslim martyr, or shahid (&#x201c;witness&#x201d; in Arabic), is transported immediately to paradise rather than having to wait for the last judgment. Martyrdom is particularly emphasized among Shiites, whose identity has been profoundly shaped by the suffering and death of Muhammad&#x2019;s grandson Husayn (625&#x2013;680) during a battle at Karbala on the banks of the Euphrates in 680, an event commemorated annually by Shiites in the festival of Muharram. During the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, martyrdom became a terrorist strategy for suicide bombers in Israel, Iraq, and other countries.</p>
<p>Martyrs are made by the circumstances of their lives and deaths, of course, but also and more significantly by the communities who memorialize them. In the United States devotees transformed President Lincoln and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. into American Christs. Over the last half century, adoring fans have elevated to martyr status James Dean, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Tupac Shakur, and dozens of other celebrities who suffered early and violent deaths. Cassie Bernal, who died in the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, has also been embraced as a martyr, since according to evangelical admirers she testified to her belief in God just before she was killed."</p>

<h1>Mecca</h1>
<p>"The holiest city in the Islamic world, located in modern-day Saudi Arabia. Mecca is holy to Muslims because Muhammad was born there, because he received his earliest revelations in a cave outside the city, and because upon his triumphant return to Mecca in 630 CE he replaced polytheistic worship around the city&#x2019;s Kaaba shrine with monotheistic worship of the one true God. Muslims face Mecca when they pray, and mosques include a niche in the wall (mihrab) to orient them in that direction. Going at least once on the hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca is a sacred obligation for all Muslims who are physically and financially able. To keep Mecca pure, no non-Muslims are allowed in the city.</p>
<p>One of America&#x2019;s great spiritual memoirs, The Autobiography of Malcolm X (1965), turns on the pilgrimage to Mecca of this African American convert to the Nation of Islam. While on the hajj, Malcolm X comes to see himself not so much in racial as in religious terms&#x2014;as a Muslim among Muslims. Osama bin Laden has indicated that he and al-Qaeda began their &#x201c;holy war&#x201d; against the United States because Americans put troops in the Muslim holy land in Saudi Arabia after the first Gulf War. Mecca has also become a generic term in American English, where it connotes the world center of something. For example, Moab, Utah, is described as a mecca for mountain bikers and Colorado Springs, Colorado, as an evangelical Christian mecca."</p>

It is also the city where he built the first mosque, where he died, and where he is buried. Muhammad&#x2019;s flight in 622 from Mecca to Medina&#x2014;known as the hijra&#x2014;is so important in Islam that Muslims date their lunar calendar from that moment. (Much of 2007 CE falls for them in 1427 AH&#x2014;&#x201c;in the year of the hijra.&#x201d;) During the 1990s some American Muslims began speaking of transforming the United States into a Medina, by which they meant it was time to establish an American ummah&#x2014;an Islamic community that was both authentically American and authentically Islamic."</p>

<h1>monotheism</h1>
<p>"Belief shared by Jews, Christians, Muslims, and others that there is only one god. (By contrast, polytheism affirms the existence of multiple gods and atheism denies them all.) In 1954 the US Congress inserted the phrase &#x201c;under God&#x201d; into the Pledge of Allegiance, suggesting that the United States is officially monotheistic&#x2014;a view reinforced after 9/11 by repeated public references to the country as a Judeo-Christian-Islamic nation and by the Supreme Court&#x2019;s refusal to take &#x201c;under God&#x201d; out of the pledge in Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow (2004). Opponents of monotheism include Buddhists who typically affirm no divinity and Hindus who typically affirm many, though it should be noted that many Hindus call themselves monotheists."</p>

</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>Moral Majority</h1>
<p>"The most visible and powerful instrument of the Religious Right during the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. This pressure group was founded in 1979 by the Reverend Jerry Falwell (b. 1933), a fundamentalist Baptist pastor, Liberty University chancellor, and televangelist. The group defined itself not in narrowly Baptist or even Christian terms but as a Judeo-Christian organization open to Protestants, Catholics, and Jews committed to promoting &#x201c;family values&#x201d; by opposing pornography, homosexuality, abortion, feminism, and secular humanism. After helping to send California&#x2019;s governor, Ronald Reagan, to the White House in 1980, the group drew fire from the Secular Left for ostensibly violating the separation of church and state. From the right, Faith for the Family magazine of Bob Jones University criticized the Moral Majority for selling Jesus out to politics, blasting the group as &#x201c;one of Satan&#x2019;s devices to build the world church of Antichrist.&#x201d;269 With the Religious Right a fixture on the American political scene, Falwell dissolved the organization in 1989, the same year that another religious broadcaster, Pat Robertson, established a like-minded but more narrowly Christian pressure group called the Christian Coalition. Since that time Falwell has continued to stir the pot of the culture wars, particularly on matters of sexual ethics. On September 13, 2001, Falwell pinned blame for 9/11 on &#x201c;the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and lesbians&#x2026;who have tried to secularize America.&#x201d;"</p>

<h1>Mormonism</h1>
<p>"Religious movement founded in New York in the 1820s by Joseph Smith Jr. (1805&#x2013;1844). According to Smith, an angel revealed to him the location of gold tablets buried in the fifth century in modern-day upstate New York. Smith found the tablets, used two seer stones to translate their &#x201c;Reformed Egyptian&#x201d; into English, and published the resulting Book of Mormon in 1830. In that book, which Mormons view as scripture, Jesus visits the New World after his resurrection and before his ascension, founding his true church among Native Americans.</p>
<p>Widely persecuted for their distinctive beliefs and practices (which came to include polygamy), Mormons moved westward from New York to Ohio and Missouri before settling in Illinois, where Smith was arrested, jailed, and then killed by a mob in 1844. Mormons later migrated under the direction of Brigham Young (1801&#x2013;1877) to Utah, where they established something of a theocratic state. After the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the official name of the largest Mormon church) renounced polygamy in 1890, Utah was admitted into the Union as the forty-fifth state.</p>
<p>Mormons recognize four scriptures: the Bible (&#x201c;as far as it is translated correctly&#x201d;), the Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price, and Doctrine and Covenants. But they also believe in ongoing revelation, investing in their successive presidents the power of prophecy. In 1978 President Spencer Kimball announced a revelation that lifted a prior ban on African American men becoming priests. Today Mormons&#x2019; distinctive practices include baptism for the dead and marriage for eternity, and their distinctive beliefs include the corporeality of God and the eternal progression of humans into godhood. Mormons also follow a health code called the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the ingestion of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine.</p>
<p>Mormonism was widely discussed in the United States during the 2002 Winter Olympics, held in the shadow of LDS international headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. Although once seen as un-American, Mormons are now viewed by many as quintessentially American. The LDS Church reports over 4 million members in the United States and 12 million worldwide and is one of the world&#x2019;s fastest growing religious movements. Some have predicted that Mormonism is well on its way to becoming the first great world religion since Islam. It has already become an American political force. Mormons were overrepresented relative to their total population in the 109th Congress, and in 2006 the governors of both Utah and Massachusetts were LDS members."</p>

<h1>Orthodox Christianity</h1>
<p>"Along with Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, one of Christianity&#x2019;s three main branches. Orthodoxy split from Roman Catholicism in 1054 over the now arcane matter of whether the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone (the Orthodox position) or from both the Father and Son (as the Catholics claimed). Orthodox Christianity is led today by patriarchs with authority in their own nations yet in communion with one another. (There is no Orthodox pope.) Of all the dimensions of religion, Orthodox piety emphasizes ritual, more specifically the celebration of the Eucharist&#x2014;the &#x201c;mystery of mysteries&#x201d;&#x2014;which is done in a high style, complete with incense, sacred music, and colorful clerical vestments. When it comes to priests and marriage, the Orthodox split the difference between Protestantism and Catholicism, allowing parish priests to marry but insisting on celibacy for bishops (who are recruited from the monastic ranks). Orthodox Christians practice baptism by immersion and call confirmation chrismation (because of its use of holy oil, or chrism). Finally, this tradition makes considerable use of icons, so much so that Orthodoxy can be described as Christianity conveyed through sight.</p>
<p>Orthodox Christians arrived in North America as early as a 1794 Russian mission to Alaska, but their numbers remained small until immigration from Greece, Russia, and other Orthodox countries picked up in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There are roughly 100 million Orthodox Christians in the world, with perhaps 5 million in the United States. The largest Orthodox group in the United States is the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.</p>

So, for example, Orthodox Jews strictly observe the Sabbath and eat only kosher food. This community is divided into Modern Orthodox Jews and Haredi Jews (including Hasidic Jews). Of these two groups, the Modern Orthodox are more open to secular influences and Haredis most zealous about separating themselves from non-Jewish influences. Orthodox Jews arrived in the New World as early as 1654, and they came in significant numbers from Eastern Europe between the 1880s and the 1920s. Orthodox institutions in the United States include New York&#x2019;s Yeshiva University and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America."</p>

Since the First Vatican Council of 1870, Catholics have affirmed that the pope can speak infallibly on matters of faith and morals. One long-standing concern in American political life has been that Catholic politicians would take their marching orders not from the people who elected them but from the pope. Responding to this concern, Massachusetts senator John Kennedy pledged during his 1960 presidential campaign that he would neither request not accept political advice or instructions from any pope. &#x201c;I am not the Catholic candidate for president,&#x201d; Kennedy said, but a candidate &#x201c;who happens also to be a Catholic.&#x201d;"</p>

<h1>predestination</h1>
<p>"Belief that God has predetermined the eternal destiny of each individual, assigning the elect to heaven and (in the case of &#x201c;double predestination&#x201d;) the damned to hell. This view, which accents God&#x2019;s sovereignty at the expense of human free will, characterized the theology of the Swiss theologian John Calvin and, through him, Puritanism and other expressions of Reformed theology. The most famous opponent of predestination was the Dutchman Jacob Arminius (1559&#x2013;1609), whose &#x201c;Arminian&#x201d; theology insisted that human beings were free to cooperate with God in their salvation or damnation. Divine sovereignty trounced free will at the Synod of Dort (1618&#x2013;1619) and in the Westminster Confession (1647), both of which affirmed predestination, but Arminianism routed Calvinism during the Second Great Awakening and predominates among American Christians today.</p>

<h1>Promised Land</h1>
<p>"In the Hebrew Bible, the land of Canaan promised by God to Abraham and claimed by the people of Israel following their exile. The longing for this &#x201c;land flowing with milk and honey&#x201d; (Exodus 3:8) contributed mightily to Zionism and the creation of the state of Israel, but the Promised Land is also a recurring image in American history. The Pilgrims saw the New World as a Promised Land, African slaves saw the North as their Canaan, and Mormons saw Utah as theirs. Many American spirituals and hymns conflate heaven with the Promised Land. The most famous use of this phrase in American public life occurs in the &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve Been to the Mountaintop&#x201d; speech the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered on April 3, 1968, one day before his assassination. &#x201c;It really doesn&#x2019;t matter what happens now,&#x201d; King said. &#x201c;Like anybody, I would like to live a long life.

<h1>Protestantism</h1>
<p>"One of Christianity&#x2019;s three main branches, along with Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, and the dominant form of American Christianity. As the name implies, Protestantism began as a protest. In sixteenth-century Europe, thinkers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin harshly criticized the Roman Catholic Church, and, thanks to advances in literacy and print technology, these criticisms reached a large and ready audience. Whereas Catholics had long argued that salvation results from both faith and works, these reformers insisted on sola fide (&#x201c;faith alone&#x201d;). Whereas Catholics had based their tradition on the authority of both the Bible and tradition, Protestants insisted on the authority of the Bible alone (sola scriptura). Protestants also whittled the Catholics&#x2019; seven sacraments down to two: baptism and Holy Communion. Other distinctive beliefs of the Reformation included &#x201c;the priesthood of all believers,&#x201d; an egalitarian posture that elevated the status of the laity at the expense of priests.</p>
<p>As Protestantism broke with the pope and set off on its own, it formed four main branches: Lutheranism, Calvinism, Anglicanism, and Anabaptism. Lutherans followed the lead of Luther and were particularly strong in Germany and Scandinavian countries. The Calvinist or Reformed tradition looked for leadership to Calvin and the Swiss theologian Ulrich Zwingli. It produced the Puritan impulse as well as three key denominational families: Presbyterians, Baptists, and Congregationalists. The Anglican tradition emerged when King Henry VIII set himself up as the head of the Church of England in 1534. It later gave birth to Methodism, which gestated the Holiness and Pentecostal movements. The most radical wing of the Reformation, the Anabaptists (or &#x201c;rebaptizers&#x201d;), insisted on adult rather than infant baptism, the strict separation of church and state, and pacifism. Groups such as the Mennonites and the Amish developed out of this Anabaptist branch."</p>

<h1>Puritanism</h1>
<p>"Sixteenth-century Protestant movement to &#x201c;purify&#x201d; the Church of England of unscriptural beliefs and practices, particularly lingering vestiges of Roman Catholicism (including the celebration of Christmas). The most radical Puritans&#x2014;the Pilgrims among them&#x2014;separated from the Church of England, which they regarded as apostate; nonseparating Puritans sought to change the Church of England from within. Many immigrants to the British colonies were Puritans, and Puritanism became the dominant theology in New England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Puritans came to the New World in search of religious freedom, but they did not extend that courtesy to others. Separation of church and state was unknown to them; they sought to create &#x201c;Holy Commonwealths&#x201d;&#x2014;in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven&#x2014;that dealt strictly, sometimes lethally, with Quakers, Baptists, and other dissenters who did not share their understanding of scripture.</p>
<p>American Puritanism was dominated by Calvinism, or Reformed theology, which originated with the thought of the Swiss theologian John Calvin. Much of the dynamism of Puritan thought derived from two Calvinist emphases: the absolute sovereignty of God and the total depravity of human beings. Given God&#x2019;s power and human sinfulness, Puritans were convinced that salvation was not a matter of individual free will; God had predestined all human beings either to heaven or to hell. Although Puritans have often been described as priggish and prudish&#x2014;hence the term puritanical&#x2014;they were not killjoys. Regarding alcohol as the &#x201c;good creature of God,&#x201d; they drank liberally at weddings, ordinations, and funerals. Their religion, moreover, was not as pure as many Puritan thinkers would have liked. Few Puritans took their Calvinist theology neat. They told folktales, read the stars for signs and portents, dabbled in magic, and heeded the dreams and visions of &#x201c;cunning folk.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Along with evangelicalism, Puritanism is one of the two most influential religious movements in American history. It profoundly influenced the Presbyterians and the Congregationalists. It also bequeathed to evangelicalism an emphasis on experience, particularly the experience of conversion, and on sola scriptura, or &#x201c;scripture alone.&#x201d; But far more than evangelicals, Puritans valued the doctrinal and narrative dimensions of religion, believing that learning was a matter of the head as well as the heart."</p>

Their name may derive from an exchange between Fox and a British judge; after Fox instructed the judge to &#x201c;tremble at the Word of the Lord,&#x201d; the judge reportedly called him &#x201c;a quaker.&#x201d; Friends, as Quakers are also called, are best known for their opposition to war and for their refusal to take oaths. Their distinctive services, which forgo both clergy and sacraments, emphasize silence and spontaneity.</p>
<p>Quakers played an important role in early American history. Quaker William Penn (1644&#x2013;1718) founded Pennsylvania in 1681 as a safe haven for Quakers and granted liberty of conscience to all but atheists. Quakers also played key roles in nineteenth-century social reform movements, including the campaign for woman&#x2019;s suffrage. Their belief in the equality of all human beings before God&#x2014;a belief manifested in their refusal to tip their hats to monarchs&#x2014;propelled them to the forefront of the abolitionist movement. The American Friends Service Committee, founded by Quakers in 1917, remains a key voice on issues of peace, justice, and human rights. Both President Nixon and President Herbert Hoover were Friends (though of the &#x201c;fighting Quaker&#x201d; sort). Today the Religious Society of Friends is a small denomination with roughly one hundred thousand American members.</p>

	<title>Quran</title>
</head>
<body>
<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>Quran</h1>
<p>"The holy book of Islam, the final revelation of Allah, and the ultimate authority for Muslims in law, religion, and ethics. Muslims affirm that this scripture was miraculously revealed by Allah via the angel Gabriel to Muhammad, recited by Muhammad, memorized by his companions, written down by scribes, and later compiled into a codex. The first revelation came in 610 CE, and the official version was canonized (in Arabic) decades after Muhammad&#x2019;s death in 632. While Muslims affirm that the Hebrew and Christian Bibles were revealed by God, they believe that both scriptures have been corrupted over time. The Quran, by contrast, exists today just as it was originally delivered. It is authoritative only in the Arabic original; translations are understood to be human products.</p>
<p>The Quran, which is about as long as the New Testament, consists of 114 chapters or suras, which vary in length from 3 to 286 ayas (verses), organized largely from longest to shortest. Commentators divide these chapters into recitations received by Muhammad in Mecca (Meccan suras) and those received by him after his flight to Medina (Medinan suras). The Quran&#x2019;s first sura is the Fatihah (&#x201c;The Opening&#x201d;):</p>
<p>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,</p>
<p>The Beneficent, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Master of the Day of Judgment,</p>
<p>Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help.</p>
<p>Show us the straight path,</p>
<p>The path of those whom Thou hast favored; Not the (path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.</p>
<p>The best way for newcomers to read the Quran is not from front to back but from back to front. Start with the Fatihah, but then skip to the shorter, more theological suras in the back. Then read the narratives of the prophets (toward the middle) before concluding with the legalistic content of the long suras at the front.</p>
<p>In addition to the unity of God and the prophethood of Muhammad, the Quran teaches the bodily resurrection and a coming judgment. It requires prayers and almsgiving and fasting and pilgrimage. It portrays a world in which one God repeatedly reveals his will to human beings through prophets and messengers that stretch from Moses to Jesus to Muhammad. Jesus is mentioned nearly one hundred times in the Quran, where he is hailed as both miracle worker and messiah. Though Muslims affirm the virgin birth of Jesus, they do not believe that he was killed on a cross or raised from the dead. They believe instead that he ascended into paradise.</p>
<p>After 9/11, and particularly after it was learned that one of the hijackers had a Quran in his suitcase, interest in the Quran skyrocketed in the United States. &#x201c;Anyone concerned with what&#x2019;s happening in our world ought to spend some time reading the Quran,&#x201d; CBS commentator Andy Rooney said, and for months after 9/11 Qurans outsold Bibles in many bookstores. Although awareness of the Quran is new to the United States, controversies about this scripture are not unknown. In 2002 conservative Christian groups protested after the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assigned a book on the Quran to its incoming students. In 2005 the US military admitted to mishandling the Quran at its prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And some Muslims testifying in US courts have asked judges to allow them to swear in on the Quran rather than the Bible."</p>

It is now traditional for US presidents to send greetings to Muslims and to host fast-breaking dinners at the White House during Ramadan. Travelers, the sick, the elderly, children, and pregnant and nursing women are generally exempt from fasting during Ramadan."</p>

<h1>Reform Judaism</h1>
<p>"One of the three main branches in Judaism&#x2014;alongside Orthodox and Conservative&#x2014;and the most liberal. Like liberal Protestantism, Reform Judaism is in part a product of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. It achieved clear expression in the United States in the Pittsburgh Platform (1885), in which Reform rabbis referred to Judaism as &#x201c;a progressive religion, ever striving to be in accord with the postulates of reason&#x201d; and accepted as binding only the moral (as opposed to the ritual and dietary) laws of their tradition. Unlike Orthodox Jews, Reform Jews ordain women and worship in vernacular languages. And while Orthodox Jews trace Jewish identity through the mother only, Reform Jews typically view a child as Jewish if either parent was. Reform Judaism is represented in the United States in Hebrew Union College&#x2013;Jewish Institute of Religion and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. It is the largest branch of American Judaism, claiming 39 percent of America&#x2019;s religious Jews.</p>

<h1>Reformation</h1>
<p>"Movement in sixteenth-century Europe that intended to reform the Roman Catholic Church but instead gave birth to Protestantism. Sparked in 1517 in Wittenberg, Germany, when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses against indulgences (payments for the remission of sins), the Reformation spread across Europe, producing four types of Protestantism: the Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, and Anabaptist traditions. The key slogans of the Reformation were &#x201c;justification by grace through faith,&#x201d; &#x201c;the priesthood of all believers,&#x201d; and sola scriptura (Bible alone). Its key impulse was rejection of papal and priestly authority in the name of individual conscience&#x2014;an impulse that would produce thousands of different Protestant denominations and redraw the map of Europe."</p>

<h1>reincarnation</h1>
<p>"Belief, common among Hindus, that souls take on new bodies after death as part of a never-ending cycle of birth, death, life, and rebirth known as samsara. Buddhists also affirm reincarnation, but because they deny the existence of an eternal soul, they typically contend that it is one&#x2019;s consciousness that is reborn. Most of those who affirm reincarnation understand this process to be driven by karma, or the law of actions and their consequences. According to this law, the rebirth you get is the rebirth you deserve. Although reincarnation derives from Asian religions, roughly one-quarter of US Christians believe in it too. However, while Asian religious practitioners typically understand reincarnation to be undesirable&#x2014;their ultimate goal is to escape from samsara (and thus from rebirth)&#x2014;Americans who affirm reincarnation typically see it as a welcome opportunity to do things in the next life that they could not do in this one."</p>

<!--   ** Standard Tinderbox Template [section page] **  -->

<h1>resurrection</h1>
<p>"Belief that the dead will rise on some future day to stand for final judgment. This doctrine, which foresees the reunion of souls with the bodies lost to them at death, is closely associated with the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic conviction that a person is an indivisible combination of body and soul. Resurrection belief appears in Judaism fairly late&#x2014;in such apocalyptic texts as 2 Maccabees, written a century before the life of Jesus. It was later adopted and adapted by Christians, for whom the resurrection of Jesus, celebrated on Easter, is a central affirmation. Bodily resurrection is also a Muslim belief. Today Orthodox Jews continue to affirm this doctrine, but many Reform Jews either believe simply in the immortality of the soul or prefer not to speculate about the afterlife. The Apostles&#x2019; Creed of the Christians affirms &#x201c;the resurrection of the body,&#x201d; but Christians disagree about what shape this body will take in heaven. (1 Corinthians 15:44 says the &#x201c;natural body,&#x201d; which is buried, will become a &#x201c;spiritual body.&#x201d;) Belief in the resurrection is closely tied to the tradition of martyrdom, whose logic demands that God mete out rewards and punishments in the afterlife. Like the doctrine of the bodily resurrection, martyrdom is a Jewish development that makes its way into Christianity and Islam."</p>

Jews traditionally observe the Sabbath on Saturday and Christians on Sunday. Seventh-Day Adventists, however, observe a Saturday Sabbath.

There is even a Church of Satan, founded in San Francisco in 1966 by Anton LaVey (1930&#x2013;1997), who was also the author of The Satanic Bible (1969). Ayatollah Khomeini, the Shiite cleric who led the Iranian Revolution of 1979, famously referred to the United States as &#x201c;the Great Satan.&#x201d;</h3>

Fundamentalists responded to this humiliation by withdrawing from public view for decades, focusing during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s on building their own subculture of Bible schools, seminaries, radio stations, and publishing houses. They reemerged in the late 1970s as a powerful political force, intent on introducing &#x201c;creationism&#x201d; to public school students. The Scopes Trial, which served as something of a dress rehearsal for the contemporary culture wars, was fictionalized on Broadway in 1955 and on celluloid in 1960 as Inherit the Wind."</p>

<h1>Second Vatican Council</h1>
<p>"The second great council of the Roman Catholic Church (the first was held in 1869&#x2013;1870), convened in 1962 by Pope John XXIII in an effort to effect an aggorniamento (updating) of the church in the modern world. One important outcome of this council, which concluded in 1965 under Pope Paul VI, was a more democratic understanding of the church itself, which was redefined as the entire &#x201c;people of God&#x201d; rather than a hierarchy of popes, bishops, and priests. Another outcome was an affirmation of religious freedom and the separation of church and state. Yet another was a greater openness to other forms of Christianity and other religions&#x2014;an openness that extended to a repudiation of both anti-Semitism and the long-standing dogma that &#x201c;there is no salvation outside the Church.&#x201d; In terms of politics, this council condemned the nuclear arms race in the name of peace and supported in the name of justice the right of workers to organize. Its affirmation of &#x201c;the dignity of the human person&#x201d; contributed, particularly in Latin America, to the legitimation of liberation theology and its &#x201c;preferential option for the poor.&#x201d; Vatican II also called for greater attention to the Bible in private piety, church services, and theology, but there is little evidence that this reorientation made American Catholics more biblically literate. Following this council American Catholics applied the aggorniamento dictum to catechesis, by dropping rote memorization of the Baltimore Catechism in CCD (Confraternity of Christian Doctrine) classes and introducing more experiential approaches to faith, including an emphasis on social service. In terms of the daily lives of American Catholics, the key outcomes were a lifting of the ban on eating meat on Fridays and the decision to allow Mass to be celebrated in vernacular languages rather than Latin only."</p>

<h1>secular humanism</h1>
<p>"More an epithet of the Religious Right than a self-designation, secular humanism refers to the view that human beings can get along just fine without God. As such, it stands in stark opposition to the Judeo-Christian tradition, both theologically (because it does not affirm God) and morally (because it denies God-given moral absolutes). In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black referred in a footnote to &#x201c;Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism&#x201d; as &#x201c;religions in this country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief in the existence of God.&#x201d; Pointing to this dictum, some conservative Christians and Jews have argued that secular humanism, which they view as the villain behind America&#x2019;s moral degradation, has replaced Christianity (or Judeo-Christianity) as the de facto religion of America&#x2019;s public schools. In the early 1990s a science teacher in California brought a federal lawsuit claiming that his school district, by insisting that he teach evolution, was unconstitutionally forcing him to teach the &#x201c;religion&#x201d; of secular humanism. &#x201c;We reject this claim,&#x201d; wrote the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, &#x201c;because neither the Supreme Court, nor this circuit, has ever held that evolutionism or secular humanism are &#x2018;religions&#x2019; for Establishment Clause purposes.&#x201d; Religion or not, this viewpoint has its supporters, who are represented by the Council for Secular Humanism."</p>

Different Shiite groups recognize different schools of legal interpretation. Sunnis recognize four: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafii, and Hanbali.

<p>"Along with Sunni Islam, one of the two main divisions in the Muslim tradition, and the smaller of the two. After the death of Muhammad in 632, the Muslim community split over the question of succession. One party, which became the Sunni majority, determined his successors by election, referring to them as caliphs. Another party insisted that Muhammad&#x2019;s successors be drawn from his family. They followed Muhammad&#x2019;s son-in-law Ali, referring to him as their imam and calling themselves Shiites or Shias (lit. &#x201c;partisans&#x201d; of Ali). Unlike Sunnis, who invest only political authority in their caliphs (leaving spiritual authority in the Muslim community as a whole), Shiites invest both political and spiritual authority in their imams. They view as authoritative not only the Quran and the hadith but also the teachings of their imams, whom they see as intercessors between themselves and Allah. Shiites disagree on how many imams followed Ali, but the largest Shiite faction affirms a line of twelve and believes that the final imam, who went into hiding, will return at the end of time to restore peace and justice on earth. One key moment in Shiite history was the murder at Karbala in 680 of Husayn, Muhammad&#x2019;s grandson and the third Shiite imam. This event, remembered every year by Shiites in the festival of Muharram, has made Shiites more receptive to the tradition of martyrdom than their Sunni counterparts. Shiism is the most popular form of Islam in Iran and Iraq, and there are large Shiite populations in Pakistan, India, Azerbaijan, Lebanon, Syria, and Afghanistan. Roughly 15 percent of the world&#x2019;s Muslims are Shiites."</p>

<h1>Shoah</h1>
<p>"The mass murder of roughly six million Jews by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, prompted in part by centuries of Christian theology that branded the Jews as Christ killers. Also known as the Shoah (Hebrew for &#x201c;calamity&#x201d;), this event, which included the murders of millions of homosexuals, Gypsies, Poles, Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, the handicapped, and other non-Jewish minorities, has raised profound theological questions among believers about the existence and goodness of God in a world that is witness to such evil. It has also raised questions about the contributions of Christian theology to this act of genocide. Widespread revulsion at the efforts of the Nazi regime to exterminate the Jews helped to pave the way for creation of the state of Israel in 1948. The story of the Holocaust is told in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC."</p>

Mel Gibson structured his movie The Passion of the Christ (2004) on the stations of the cross&#x2014;a fact lost on Protestants (and Catholics) unfamiliar with this tradition.</p>

Sunni Muslims, therefore, are those who adhere strictly to the traditions of the Quran and the exemplary sayings and actions of Muhammad&#x2014;&#x201c;the way of the prophet&#x201d;&#x2014;as recorded in the hadith. Sunnis split from Shiites after Muhammad&#x2019;s death, when Sunnis said that the prophet&#x2019;s successor should be elected by the ummah, or Muslim community, rather than coming (as Shiites insisted) from Muhammad&#x2019;s bloodline. Sunnis invest less authority in their leaders than do Shiites. They view Shiite prayers uttered in the name of Ali or Husayn or other imams as violations of the principle of divine oneness (tawhid). Roughly 85 percent of the world&#x2019;s Muslims are Sunnis. Countries where Sunni Islam predominates include Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey."</p>

In 2001 the Taliban destroyed two giant Buddhas carved in the third century CE into the cliffs in Afghanistan&#x2019;s Bamiyan valley. Because the Taliban had provided shelter to Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network, they were attacked and defeated by American and other forces after 9/11. During the Taliban&#x2019;s short reign only three of the world&#x2019;s fifty-three Muslim-majority countries officially recognized their government."</p>

When asked to summarize the Torah while standing on one leg, Hillel answered: &#x201c;What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the whole Torah; the rest is commentary.

<h1>Wahhabism</h1>
<p>"Ultraconservative Sunni Muslim revitalization movement that aims to reverse the moral decline of the Muslim world by returning to the pure Islam of the Quran and Muhammad. Opponents gave Wahhabis their name, which derives from founder Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703&#x2013;1792), a scholar of the Sunnis&#x2019; conservative Hanbali school. But Wahhabis often refer to themselves either as Muwahhidun (upholders of divine unity) or as Salafis, a broader but closely related school that denounces as apostates Muslims who deviate from the beliefs and practices of the first three generations of Muslims (the righteous &#x201c;predecessors&#x201d;: Salaf). Wahhabism, which has been compared with both Unitarianism and Puritanism, rejects as corruptions of the pure faith virtually all medieval and modern accretions to Islam, including popular devotions to saints and Sufimysticism. Wahhabis are particularly zealous about strict adherence to Shariah, or Islamic law. They reject the separation of church and state, and they regard Muslims who do not accept their views as heretics. This movement, which dates to the 1740s in Arabia, won the support of the Bedouin chief Muhammad ibn Saud in 1747 and became dominant in modern-day Saudi Arabia (though many Wahhabis criticized the House of Saud when it opened the nation up to Western influences after the discovery of oil in the 1930s). In recent decades Wahhabism spread to Afghanistan under the Taliban regime and, thanks to an aggressive mosque-building program funded by Saudis, into mosques in Europe and the United States. Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are both influenced by Wahhabism, but the greater influence on each seems to be the thought of the Egyptian radical Sayyid Qutb."</p>

<h1>yoga</h1>
<p>"Although yoga has in recent years come to refer to India-derived body postures and stretching exercises, this Sanskrit term originally meant &#x201c;discipline.&#x201d; In Hinduism (from which yoga derives), there are many yogas, including the discipline of knowledge (jnana yoga) and the discipline of devotion (bhakti yoga). The contemporary craze for yoga as exercise derives from hatha yoga or the discipline of force, which was itself originally a mode of raja yoga (the discipline of royalty). Its key elements, which go back thousands of years in India, are bodily postures (asana) and breath control (pranayama). Its ultimate aim is nothing less than to &#x201c;yoke&#x201d;&#x2014;the term yoga is related to the English word yoke&#x2014;one&#x2019;s true self (Atman) with Ultimate Reality (Brahman). In other words, classic yogis did not separate yogic techniques from Hindu religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>Americans&#x2019; interest in yoga dates to the arrival of Swami Vivekananda, the first Hindu missionary to the United States, at the World&#x2019;s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. But neither Vivekananda nor the Vedanta Society that he founded one year later emphasized what we now know as yoga. That practice first took off in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, when such teachers as Indra Devi took the Hinduism out of it, stressing physical fitness and mental health instead. Yoga went mainstream in the 1990s, when pop stars such as Sting became associated with it. In 1999 Madonna won a Grammy for her Ray of Light CD, which included a Sanskrit track praising Patanjali, the ancient author of the Yoga Sutras. In 2001 Time magazine put the yoga craze on its cover, as did the New Yorker two years later. Today secularized forms of yoga, severed almost entirely from its Hindu roots, are offered in many health clubs, university gyms, and even churches. A Christian version of yoga, known as PraiseMoves, is popular among evangelicals."</p>

<h1>Zen</h1>
<p>"The Japanese term Zen derives from the Sanskrit term dhyana, meaning meditation. So Zen is a meditation school of Buddhism. More specifically, it is a Mahayana Buddhist school that uses various techniques to attain satori (enlightenment). It was popularized in the United States by the Zen layman D. T. Suzuki (1870&#x2013;1966) and by Jack Kerouac and other members of the Beat generation, who together helped to kick off a Zen vogue in 1950s America. The popularity of Robert Pirsig&#x2019;s bestseller, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (1974) prompted authors to write hundreds of &#x201c;Zen and&#x201d; titles&#x2014;from Zen and the Art of Poker to Zen and the Art of Happiness."</p>

<h1>Zionism</h1>
<p>"Movement to create a Jewish nation in the land of Zion, namely Israel/Palestine. This movement, rooted in the Jewish hope for a messiah who would fulfill God&#x2019;s promise of a land for Abraham&#x2019;s descendants, dates to the destruction of the First Temple in 586 BCE and the subsequent scattering of the Jews into the diaspora. It took political form in 1897 when Theodor Herzl convened in Basel, Switzerland, the First Zionist Congress, which aimed to create &#x201c;for the Jewish people a home in Palestine secured by public law.&#x201d; Zionism was initially opposed on the right by Orthodox Jews who thought that this task belonged to God alone and on the left by Reform Jews who did not want to be accused of having mixed loyalties to their homelands. Following the Holocaust, however, a new consensus emerged among Jews and non-Jews alike for a Jewish state, which became a reality in 1948. Today some &#x201c;Christian Zionists&#x201d; support the state of Israel because of their belief that the New Testament book of Revelation describes a Jewish state as a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus."</p>
